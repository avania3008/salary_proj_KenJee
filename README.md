## About this Project

This is a Data Science project from Scratch using Python. The main project tells about predicting salaries for data scientists, where the data were scrapped from [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com) using Python's Selenium. Most of the codes referenced from [Ken Jee's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhi4dOhmW-g&list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t&index=3) and his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj). Ken Jee's used [Arapfaik](https://github.com/arapfaik/scraping-glassdoor-selenium)'s `glassdoor_scrapper.py` as reference and [Echestare](https://github.com/echestare/001KenJeeFromScratch_DSSalary) modified Ken Jee's scrapper to synchronized the html template with the current Glassdoor page (2021).
